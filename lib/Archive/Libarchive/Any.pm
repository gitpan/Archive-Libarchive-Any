=head1 NAME

Archive::Libarchive::Any - Perl bindings to libarchive

=head1 VERSION

version 0.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Archive::Libarchive::Any;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides bindings for libarchive using either
L<Archive::Libarchive::XS> or L<Archive::Libarchive::FFI>.
The interface is identical either way.

The preference and install and run time is at the discretion
of the author of this distribution, and is subject to change
with reasonable notice in the documentation and Changes file.

Generally the XS version will be preferred, and the FFI
version will be used if the XS version is unavailable.

If you set the environment variable C<ARCHIVE_LIBARCHIVE_ANY>
to C<XS> or C<FFI> it will prefer that implementation over the
other (this is used both at install and runtime).

=head1 SEE ALSO

The intent of this module is to provide a low level fairly thin direct
interface to libarchive, on which a more Perlish OO layer could easily
be written.

=over 4

=item L<Archive::Libarchive::XS>

=item L<Archive::Libarchive::FFI>

Both of these provide the same API to libarchive via L<Alien::Libarchive>,
but the bindings are implemented in XS for one and via L<FFI::Sweet> for
the other.

=item L<Archive::Libarchive::Any>

Offers whichever is available, either the XS or FFI version.  The
actual algorithm as to which is picked is subject to change, depending
on with version seems to be the most reliable.

=item L<Archive::Peek::Libarchive>

=item L<Archive::Extract::Libarchive>

Both of these provide a higher level, less complete perlish interface
to libarchive.

=item L<Archive::Tar>

=item L<Archive::Tar::Wrapper>

Just some of the many modules on CPAN that will read/write tar archives.

=item L<Archive::Zip>

Just one of the many modules on CPAN that will read/write zip archives.

=item L<Archive::Any>

A module attempts to read/write multiple formats using different methods
depending on what perl modules are installed, and preferring pure perl
modules.
